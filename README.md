# blender-uvrandomizer
Blender Addon. Tools to apply randomness to the uv map
The tool has 5 functions, which can be applied to all faces, or to selected ones.
The first 3 are the usual ones (Translate, rotate, scale).
The fourth (Swap faces) allows you to randomly swap faces with each other.
The fifth (Shuffle) re-positions the faces in a random location, within the uv map.
