# blender-uvrandomizer
Blender Addon. Tools to apply randomness to the uv map
The tool has 5 functions, which can be applied to all faces, or to selected ones.
The first 3 are the usual ones (Translate, rotate, scale).
The fourth (Swap faces) allows you to randomly swap faces with each other.
The fifth (Shuffle) re-positions the faces in a random location, within the uv map.
At the moment it works with uv maps that do not exceed the limits (1, 1).
Although it could work on uv maps that exceed those coordinates, the addon was not tested under those conditions
