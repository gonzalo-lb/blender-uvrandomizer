# UV Randomizer v.1.00

Blender Addon.
* Tools to apply randomness to the uv map.
* The tool has 5 functions, which can be applied to all faces, or to selected ones.
* The first 3 are the usual ones (Translate, rotate, scale).
* The fourth (Swap faces) allows you to randomly swap faces with each other.
* The fifth (Shuffle) re-positions the faces in a random location, within the uv map.
* At the moment it works with uv maps that do not exceed the limits (1, 1).
* Although it could work on uv maps that exceed those coordinates, the addon was not tested under those conditions.
